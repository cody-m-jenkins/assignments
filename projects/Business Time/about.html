        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Though fictional, the Cupcake Company has been in business for over 30 years. We were founded in 1987, the
            year of the rabbit according to the Chinese zodiac, when our founder's grandmother was hit hard with a
            moment of inspiration. "I'm tired of everyone eating so much cake it makes them sick. We're opening a
            cupcake bakery, so people can have a tasty treat and not have to feel any regret!" We've been responsibly
            satisfying our customers ever since.</p>
